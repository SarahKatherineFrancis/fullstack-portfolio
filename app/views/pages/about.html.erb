          Hello there! I'm a Full Stack Developer with a unique background that combines education and technology. After spending several years as a kindergarten teacher, I decided to pursue my passion for web development and enrolled in the Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp. Since graduating, I've continued to hone my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies in the industry. Additionally, I graduated from SheCodes a year ago, which has further expanded my knowledge and experience in frontend web development.

          My experience in education has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and collaboration, which I bring to my work as a developer. I have a keen eye for detail and enjoy finding creative solutions to complex challenges. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and experimenting with new technologies. I'm excited to continue growing as a Full Stack Developer and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
